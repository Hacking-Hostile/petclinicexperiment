# Multi-Language CI/CD Pipeline Architecture

## Overview

This document describes the architecture for a universal CI/CD pipeline that automatically detects programming languages and executes appropriate build, test, and deployment processes. The architecture prioritizes **Just** as the primary orchestrator, with GitHub Actions serving as the lightweight infrastructure layer.

## Core Philosophy: Just-Centric Approach

The architecture ensures:

- **Local-CI Parity**: What works locally with `just` commands works identically in CI
- **Language Agnostic**: Same commands regardless of underlying language
- **Developer Experience**: Consistent workflow across all supported languages

---

## Architecture Components

### 1. Stack Detection Layer

**Purpose**: Automatically identify the programming language and framework used in the repository.

**Detection Methods**:

- `pom.xml` → Java/Kotlin (Maven)
- `build.gradle` → Java/Kotlin (Gradle)
- `package.json` → Node.js/React/Vue/Angular
- `go.mod` → Go
- `*.csproj` → .NET
- `pyproject.toml` → Python
- `Cargo.toml` → Rust
- `requirements.txt` → Python (pip)
- `Gemfile` → Ruby
- `composer.json` → PHP

### 2. Just File Responsibilities

**Primary Role**: Language-agnostic command orchestration and local development workflow.

#### Core Commands:

```bash
just build      # Universal build command
just test       # Universal test command
just lint       # Universal linting command
just format     # Universal code formatting
just clean      # Universal cleanup command
just run        # Universal run command
just deploy     # Universal deployment command
```

#### Language-Specific Implementations:

- **Java**: `mvn clean package` / `./gradlew build`
- **Node.js**: `npm run build` / `yarn build`
- **Go**: `go build`
- **Python**: `python -m build`
- **Rust**: `cargo build`
- **.NET**: `dotnet build`

#### Advanced Features:

- **Environment Detection**: Automatically detect and use correct language runtime
- **Dependency Management**: Handle language-specific dependency installation
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Ensure commands work on Windows, macOS, Linux
- **Error Handling**: Provide meaningful error messages for common issues

### 3. GitHub Actions Responsibilities

**Primary Role**: CI/CD infrastructure and orchestration.

#### Workflow Structure:

```yaml
name: Multi-Language CI/CD
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  detect-language:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      language: ${{ steps.detect.outputs.language }}
      build-tool: ${{ steps.detect.outputs.build-tool }}

  build-and-test:
    needs: detect-language
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-just@v1
      - run: just build
      - run: just test
      - run: just lint
```

#### Key Responsibilities:

- **Language Detection**: Parse repository files to determine language
- **Environment Setup**: Install appropriate language runtimes
- **Just Execution**: Execute `just` commands in CI environment
- **Artifact Management**: Store build artifacts and test results
- **Deployment Orchestration**: Trigger deployments based on branch/tag

### 4. Language-Specific Adapters

**Purpose**: Bridge between universal `just` commands and language-specific tools.

#### Java Adapter:

```bash
# justfile
build:
    #!/usr/bin/env bash
    if [ -f "pom.xml" ]; then
        mvn clean package
    elif [ -f "build.gradle" ]; then
        ./gradlew build
    else
        echo "No build file found"
        exit 1
    fi
```

#### Node.js Adapter:

```bash
# justfile
build:
    #!/usr/bin/env bash
    if [ -f "package.json" ]; then
        npm ci && npm run build
    else
        echo "No package.json found"
        exit 1
    fi
```

### 5. Deployment Layer

**Purpose**: Handle deployment to various environments based on language and configuration.

#### Supported Deployment Targets:

- **Docker**: Universal containerization
- **Kubernetes**: Container orchestration
- **Cloud Platforms**: AWS, Azure, GCP
- **Serverless**: AWS Lambda, Azure Functions
- **Static Hosting**: Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages

#### Deployment Commands:

```bash
just deploy:dev      # Deploy to development environment
just deploy:staging  # Deploy to staging environment
just deploy:prod     # Deploy to production environment
just deploy:docker   # Build and push Docker image
```
